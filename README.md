# Climate-ENSO-IOD-Analysis (1998 - 2019) 
This repository contains the full workflow, datasets (where allowed), and Python scripts used to analyze 20+ years of climate variability in relation to major ocean–atmosphere indices, focusing on:

1. ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation)

2. IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole)

3. Rainfall variability across India and Southeast Asia

The study covers the period 1998–2019, using multiple statistical and visualization approaches to understand the relationship between large-scale climate oscillations and monsoon precipitation.
